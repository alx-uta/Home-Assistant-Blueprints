blueprint:
  name: Motion-activated Light with illuminance, sun integration, dimmable, and brightness restore
  description: Turn on a light when motion is detected and illuminance is below a set Lux level. The light dims before turning off and restores its previous brightness when motion is detected again. Uses sun integration to determine day or night.
